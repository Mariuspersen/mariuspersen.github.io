<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm a enthusiastic programmer and hardware tinkerer with a education in electronics and computers. I was a apprentice at Kongsberg Maritime and completed my time there with a Certificate of Apprenticeship(Fagbrev)
</p>
<p>
    I have worked several different places around the Horten area, also known as Norway's Silicon Valley because of its concentration of tech companies.

<h2>Current Job</h2>
<p>
    As of right now I work at GE Vingmed and most of the time I work in production.
</p>
<p>
    I also have a lot of software projects that are actively used in production that make it easier and less error prone. 
    Simple CLI and GUI tools that do repetitive tasks where a human could easily make mistakes. If you are interested in the tools I've written, some of them are listed in the projects tab.

    Lately I have also worked in R&D where I do a lot of testing, verification and validation of hardware and software. Which I enjoy quite a lot.
