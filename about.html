<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm a enthusiastic programmer and hardware tinkerer. As of right now I work at GE Healthcare and usually work in production of hardware.
    I also often work at R&D doing verification and validation
    As I've worked here I have done a lot of software projects and created alot of tooling to make working easier and less error prone.
