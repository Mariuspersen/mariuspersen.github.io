    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <h5>A New Beginning - 19 July 2023</h3>
    <p>
        
        This is just a website I have made to contain information that I would like so share with the world,
        That includes projects I've worked and other things that interest me.
        Hopefully this page gets expanded with more interesting stuff when I have more time.
        This is it for now.
    </p>
    <h2>Regarding CV</h2>
    <h5>For those wishing to hire - 20 July 2023</h5>
    <p>
        Check out the CV if you are interested in my workexperience.
        It has a neat feature where you can switch between english and norwegian by just clicking the CV button again :)
    </p>
    <h2>Light Mode & Some Visual Updates</h2>
    <h5>It's that easy - 24 July 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There is now a light mode button in the bottom left corner for those that prefer that. 
        Next to those buttons there is now links for github and email instead of having it on a separate tab. 
        There is no fancy framework going on here, by the way. You can make a very nice and simple website in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    </p>
    <h2>Slight CV Updates</h2>
    <h5>NÃ¥ tilgjengelig i norsk og engelsk! - 1 August 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There is now language selection buttons instead of pressing CV button again. There is also now a icon present.
    </p>
    <h2>Homepage adjustments</h2>
    <h5>Now all fancy and pretty - 15 September 2023</h5>
    <p>
        Wasn't that happy with the landing page, now it looks a bit prettier and hopefully more visually appealing.
    </p>
    <h2>Added a new old project</h2>
    <h5>Spin to win! - 29 September 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There was a old project I made for work a while ago, basically a spinning wheel to find a winner for best improvements at work. I was reminded of it when some ideas were chosen via another website. It had a lot of ads, so I think adding mine here might be good for later use. You can check it out under the "Projects"-tab.
    </p>
    <h2>More CV improvements</h2>
    <h5>Better printing and some experience additions - 6 March 2024</h5>
    <p>
        When printing out the CV before, it was pretty annoying since additional elements that really dont need to be on the CV, were included. Now those are removed and the CV should be a bit cleaner when printed out. Also since last time I have updated the CV, I have worked  with Quality Assurance and final acceptance of products so that has been added to the CV.
