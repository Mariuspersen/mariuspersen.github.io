<h2>19 July 2023 - Hello World!</h2>
<p>
    This is just a website I have made to contain information that I would like so share with the world,
    That includes projects I've worked and other things that interest me.
    Hopefully this page gets expanded with more interesting stuff when I have more time.
    This is it for now.

<h2>20 July 2023 - Regarding CV</h2>
<p>
    Check out the CV if you are interested in my workexperience.
    It has a neat feature where you can switch between english and norwegian by just clicking the CV button again :)
</p>
<h2>24 July 2023 - Light Mode & Some Visual Updates</h2>
<p>
    There is now a light mode button in the bottom left corner for those that prefer that. 
    Next to those buttons there is now links for github and email instead of having it on a separate tab. 
    There is no fancy framework going on here, by the way. You can make a very nice and simple website in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
</p>
<h2>1 August 2023 - Slight CV Updates</h2>
<p>
    There is now language selection buttons instead of pressing CV button again. There is also now a icon present.
