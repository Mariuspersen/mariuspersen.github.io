    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <h5>A New Beginning - 19 July 2023</h3>
    <p>
        
        This is just a website I have made to contain information that I would like so share with the world,
        That includes projects I've worked and other things that interest me.
        Hopefully this page gets expanded with more interesting stuff when I have more time.
        This is it for now.
    </p>
    <h2>Regarding CV</h2>
    <h5>For those wishing to hire - 20 July 2023</h5>
    <p>
        Check out the CV if you are interested in my workexperience.
        It has a neat feature where you can switch between english and norwegian by just clicking the CV button again :)
    </p>
    <h2>Light Mode & Some Visual Updates</h2>
    <h5>It's that easy - 24 July 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There is now a light mode button in the bottom left corner for those that prefer that. 
        Next to those buttons there is now links for github and email instead of having it on a separate tab. 
        There is no fancy framework going on here, by the way. You can make a very nice and simple website in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    </p>
    <h2>Slight CV Updates</h2>
    <h5>NÃ¥ tilgjengelig i norsk og engelsk! - 1 August 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There is now language selection buttons instead of pressing CV button again. There is also now a icon present.
    </p>
    <h2>Homepage adjustments</h2>
    <h5>Now all fancy and pretty - 15 September 2023</h5>
    <p>
        Wasn't that happy with the landing page, now it looks a bit prettier and hopefully more visually appealing.
    </p>
