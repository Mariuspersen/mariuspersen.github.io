    <h5>A thousand words - 10 November 2025</h5>
    <p>
        In my continuing exploration for Zig and all things programming,
        there is one thing I haven't really touched that much and that is networking.
        Specifically HTTP, TCP, and just low-level networking and such.
        <br><br>
        And while I'm still not brave enough for that, Zig has a very easy HTTP server in the standard library.
        Soooo I ended up making a static website generator + server where everything is in one binary, 
        and this site is now hosted on it!

    <h2>Pictures!</h2>
    <h5>A thousand words - 18 March 2025</h5>
    <p>
        Been making a lot of cool progress on some of my hobby projects lately.
        Messing around with UEFI and baremetal x86_64 programming, 
        I can now write to the screen, read and write to memory with my allocator,
        Read keyboard inputs from PS/2, Render psf fonts and put them on the screen,
        and starting to mess around with enumerating PCI devices.
        <br><br>
        And for the Revolutionary Totally Gonna Take Over The World CISC64(It's not really complex at all) ISA,
        I now have a assembler and emulator that is turing complete.
        <br><br>
        I spiced up the projects page for this reason with some pictures!
        Go take a look :)

    <h2>More Hobby Projects!</h2>
    <h5>Wowawewa - 21 Februar 2025</h5>
    <p>
        Added some additional projects to the Hobby Projects page,
        All of them are basically exercises to get to know Zig better,
        I'm pretty sure at this point that Zig is the future.
    </p>
    <h2>Fixing some wrong dates and added hobbies to CV</h2>
    <h5>Work Work, Jobs done - 21 January 2025</h5>
    <p>
        Saw now that some of the dates of the places I had worked were wrong,
        should now be correct
    </p>
    <h2>More CV improvements</h2>
    <h5>Better printing and some experience additions - 6 March 2024</h5>
    <p>
        When printing out the CV before, it was pretty annoying since additional elements that really dont need to be on the CV, were included. Now those are removed and the CV should be a bit cleaner when printed out. Also since last time I have updated the CV, I have worked  with Quality Assurance and final acceptance of products so that has been added to the CV.
    </p>
    <h2>Added a new old project</h2>
    <h5>Spin to win! - 29 September 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There was a old project I made for work a while ago, basically a spinning wheel to find a winner for best improvements at work. I was reminded of it when some ideas were chosen via another website. It had a lot of ads, so I think adding mine here might be good for later use. You can check it out under the "Projects"-tab.
    </p>
    <h2>Homepage adjustments</h2>
    <h5>Now all fancy and pretty - 15 September 2023</h5>
    <p>
        Wasn't that happy with the landing page, now it looks a bit prettier and hopefully more visually appealing.
    </p>
    <h2>Slight CV Updates</h2>
    <h5>Nå tilgjengelig i norsk og engelsk! - 1 August 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There is now language selection buttons instead of pressing CV button again. There is also now a icon present.
    </p>
    <h2>Light Mode & Some Visual Updates</h2>
    <h5>It's that easy - 24 July 2023</h5>
    <p>
        There is now a light mode button in the bottom left corner for those that prefer that. 
        Next to those buttons there is now links for github and email instead of having it on a separate tab. 
        There is no fancy framework going on here, by the way. You can make a very nice and simple website in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    </p>
    <h2>Regarding CV</h2>
    <h5>For those wishing to hire - 20 July 2023</h5>
    <p>
        Check out the CV if you are interested in my workexperience.
        It has a neat feature where you can switch between english and norwegian by just clicking the CV button again :)
    </p>
    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <h5>A New Beginning - 19 July 2023</h3>
    <p>
        
        This is just a website I have made to contain information that I would like so share with the world,
        That includes projects I've worked and other things that interest me.
        Hopefully this page gets expanded with more interesting stuff when I have more time.
        This is it for now.
    </p>
