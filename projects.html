<h1>Things I have worked on</h1>
<p>
    <h2>Picture Assistant</h2>
    <p>Writing a electron app to take pictures with cameras of labels uses OCR to recognize the labels and match partnumber and serialnumbers from order</p>
    <h2>Logfile Extracter</h2>
    <p>C# CLI Tool that detects for USB insertion, grabs a zip archive and extracts a specific logfile, reading the contents and checking for failures</p>
    <h2>UDI Flasher</h2>
    <p>A Rust CLI tool for getting the latest builds and flashing them to USB sticks for software installation</p>
    <H2>Product Planner</H2>
    <p>A Node webserver for product planning, counting and display of different products. This webserver also does takt time and alerts when workers are supposed to have breaks. This project also included some ESP32's and some push buttons to make a control box for those who prefer physical buttons instead of a web interface to increment the count.</p>
    <h2>Warships Game</h2>
    <p>Also tried my hands on creating some video games, by far the most complete one is ShipGirlGame(Not the final name that's for sure). It's basically a attempt at making a turn based strategy game and this was the basic concept. I've yet to really have any creative ideas to expand on this game</p>

    <h2>String Builder Library</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Mariuspersen/sb">SB</a> is a single header style library for C for string manipulation and is what I used to build a basic <a href="https://github.com/Mariuspersen/reminder">reminder</a> application</p>
    <h2>Zed - A text editor written in Zig</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Mariuspersen/Zed">Zed</a> is a text editor I started on recently to explore Zig more. It now has the bare minimum required for a file editor, it can open and save files as well as arrow navigation.</p>
    <h2>Spinning Wheel</h2>
    <p>We have a insentive program at my current workplace to improve certain things, and we pick winners every month that receive some type of reward at the end. This was a way to pick the winner. <a href="#wheel" id="spin-wheel">You can try it out here</a></p>
</p> 
<h2>Current interests</h2>
<p>
    Right now I'm the process of learning various different system programming languages like C, Zig and Rust
    On my <a href="https://github.com/Mariuspersen/">Github</a> I have a few clones of coreutils like cat to practise using these languages. 
    C is really fun langugage to write code in, but can be annoying sometimes whenever it comes to memory allocation and working with strings, and to solve the latter I made a SB as mentioned above
