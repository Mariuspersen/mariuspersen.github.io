    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>
        This is just a website I have made to contain information that I would like so share with the world,
        That includes projects I've worked and other things that interest me.
        Hopefully this page gets expanded with more interesting stuff when I have more time.
        This is it for now.
    </p>
